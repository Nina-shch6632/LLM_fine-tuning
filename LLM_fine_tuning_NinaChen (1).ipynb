        "### Overview\n",
        "In this notebook, I will continue working on prompting large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Language model prompting is the process of providing a model with an input text and then having the model generate a response as output. Prompting can be used to complete breadth of tasks such as summarization (e.g., “Summarize the following paragraph: <paragraph written out here> Summary:”) or extraction (e.g., “Extract the phone number from the user bio: <bio written out here>.”).\n",
        "\n",
        "The task we are trying to solve in this homework is text rewriting. Specifically, our goal is to rewrite GoFundMe fundraising pitches to different emotions (e.g., sad). There is no off-the-shelf solution. Most studies in the rewriting tasks focus on a particular transformation type within the boundaries of single sentences. However, a fundraising pitch contains 170 words on average (calculated based on pitches in the medical category: https://www.gofundme.com/discover/medical-fundraiser) and each one is a coherent story. We will explore and develop prompts and fine-tuning strategies to enable LLMs to better rewrite GoFundMe fundraising pitches to different emotions.\n",

I hate that I'm even considering this, but at this point I probably have no pride anymore (sadly) so why not. Even if only $5 is raised that's $5 more towards these bills than I had! As most of you know, I've had some pretty big mystery medical issues going on for about 20 months or so now. With that has come all sorts of tests, procedures, medications, etc. While I have pretty decent health insurance, the bills for what I owe after insurance are starting to roll in more & more. I truly hate to beg for help, but honestly, I figured at this point what's it going to hurt if I do.

With that has come all sorts of tests, procedures, medications, etc. While I have pretty decent health insurance, the bills for what I owe after insurance are starting to roll in more & more.

I hate that I'm even considering this, but at this point I probably have no pride anymore (sadly) so why not. Even if only $5 is raised that's $5 more towards these bills than I had! As most of you know, I've had some pretty big mystery medical issues going on for about 20 months or so now. With that has come all sorts of tests, procedures, medications, etc. While I have pretty decent health insurance, the bills for what I owe after insurance are starting to roll in more & more.

I'm opening this fundraiser as a way for people to support me with current medical expenses and living expenses.
